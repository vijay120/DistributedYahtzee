Testing:


	Testing Referee-Player interactions:

		1) Run the following for a normal (no crashes by either player) match between two players: Gets expected behaviour
			MachineA (hollyhock): bash test_yahtzee_manager.sh node_name
			MachineB: bash test_yahtzee_player1.sh vijay1 enugent1 hunter1 node_name@hollyhock
			MachineC: bash test_yahtzee_player1.sh vijay2 enugent2 hunter2 node_name@hollyhock
			MachineD:
						full_node_name=node_name@hollyhock <- change this to machineA's host name whenever
						erl -noshell -run external_controller main $full_node_name request_tournament 2 5


		Results in Referee:

		(notice Game Done! at the end)
