Testing scripts (run one in each tab):

	# run the yahtzee_manager -- if you change node_name make sure you change it in every tab.
	bash test_yahtzee_manager.sh node_name
	# sanity check
	bash test_external_controller.sh node_name
	# spawn players
	bash test_yahtzee_player.sh 2   vijay1 enugent1 hunter1 node_name@$(hostname -s)
	bash test_yahtzee_player.sh 2   vijay2 enugent2 hunter2 node_name@$(hostname -s)
	# request a tournament
	bash test_external_controller.sh node_name
	# log enugent1 out
	bash test_player_controller.sh  vijay1 enugent1
	# check statistics after the match
	erl -noshell -run external_controller main node_name@$(hostname -s) user_info enugent2
	erl -noshell -run external_controller main node_name@$(hostname -s) user_info enugent2

Testing notes:
	- After running test_external_controller, make sure it halts.
	- After running test_player_controller, make sure the corresopnding player logs out.
	- To change parameters about each request_tournament parameters, go inside test_yahtzee_player.sh and test it.
	- Alternatively, you can run
		nodename=node_name
		full_node_name=$nodename@$(hostname -s)
		MAX_NUMPLAYER=3
		GAMES_PER_MATCH=3
		erl -noshell -run external_controller main $full_node_name request_tournament $MAX_NUMPLAYER $GAMES_PER_MATCH


Tested:
[/] login/logout works
	[/] login with the same username/password
	[/] login with the a wrong password
	[/] crashing implies logout
	[/] logout update the user table
[/] statistics report
	[/] user_info with external controller
	[/] update stats after each match
[/] 4 players system and statistics updates.



Sample testing details:

	Testing Referee-Player interactions:

		1) Run the following for a normal (no crashes by either player) match between two players: Gets expected behaviour
			MachineA (hollyhock): bash test_yahtzee_manager.sh node_name
			MachineB: bash test_yahtzee_player1.sh vijay1 enugent1 hunter1 node_name@hollyhock
			MachineC: bash test_yahtzee_player1.sh vijay2 enugent2 hunter2 node_name@hollyhock
			MachineD:
						full_node_name=node_name@hollyhock <- change this to machineA's host name whenever
						erl -noshell -run external_controller main $full_node_name request_tournament 2 5


		Results in Referee:

		(notice Game Done! at the end)

		2) Do the following for one player crashing: Gets expected behaviour
			MachineB: ctrl-c

		Results in Referee:

		(notice Player B winning!)
			https://gist.github.com/vijay120/cbfeae01df15ff39068f


		3) Do the following for both players crashing: Gets expected behaviour

		Results in Referee:

		(notice bye! in the end)
			https://gist.github.com/vijay120/748c2fcf45cc7315ae72

		4) Test that crashing (by Ctrl + C) will automatically update the status of the player to logout.

		Results in the System Manager:
			(notice the true (indicating the player is logged-in) changes to false)

		5) Test login the second time with a wrong password:
